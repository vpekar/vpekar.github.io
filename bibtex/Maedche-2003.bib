 abstract = {Ontologies may help to facilitate the finding and use of Web information. However, the engineering of an ontology may turn out to be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, we exploit ontology learning techniques that automate ontology engineering to some extent. In this chapter, we focus on the learning of the taxonomic backbone of ontologies, presenting a survey on algorithms as well as on some new ideas that consider the structure of existing ontology parts. Eventually, we describe an evaluation of our proposal and give concrete results.},
